# HsConnect
_Imagine one app where you can do it all â€” from finding teammates to joining events._

ðŸŽ‰Introducing HsConnect (okay, name still TBD â€” weâ€™ll find something cooler): a super-app built just for high schoolers.

In a world where teens juggle dozens of apps for chatting, school, news, events, and networking â€” why not bring it all together in one safe, teen-focused space? HsConnect aims to be the WeChat of high schoolers, but better â€” combining:

- ðŸ‘¥ Social networking with classmates and peers from other schools
- ðŸ“† Event discover and participation, both local and global
- ðŸ’¬ Chat, communication & collaboration tools
- ðŸ“° Curated news and learning feeds just for teens
- ðŸ’³ Tools for managing school clubs, projects, even finances

All in one clean, safe, teen-first platform.
